    During my time at Villanova University, I immersed myself in campus life and leadership while also excelling academically, graduating a semester early. I dedicated all four years to the Villanova Band, performing at nearly every sports game and contributing to the vibrant school spirit. In my junior and senior years, I took on the role of Historian, managing the band's social media presence by capturing and sharing photos and videos of our performances. Additionally, I was an active member of The Society of Scientists and Engineers, eventually joining the electoral board as the Social Media Coordinator and Vice President. Through this organization, I helped plan and host events aimed at guiding underclassmen toward success, such as resume reviews, formal events, and social gatherings that fostered community and professional growth. These experiences allowed me to develop my leadership skills, foster meaningful connections, and make the most of my time at Villanova.

<h1>₊✩‧₊˚౨ৎMusic౨ৎ˚₊✩‧₊</h1>
<p>Music has always been a cornerstone of my life. Since the fourth grade, when I first picked up the trumpet, it has been more than just a hobby—it's been a lifelong passion. My dedication to music has led me to participate in a variety of ensembles, including concert band, jazz band, percussion ensemble, and more throughout my early education.  

  High school was an especially transformative time for me musically. I had the incredible opportunity to spend two consecutive years performing with the Macy’s Great American Marching Band at the Thanksgiving Day Parade, a highlight of which was being selected during my senior year to perform on the **Today Show** the morning of Thanksgiving.  
  
  Leadership in music has also been a defining part of my journey. I was honored to lead my high school marching band as Drum Major for two years, after serving as Section Leader, Drill Sergeant, and Drill Major. These roles deepened my love for music, taught me the value of teamwork and discipline, and allowed me to help others find their own passion for performance.  
  
  From the concert stage to the marching field, music has shaped who I am, and I’m grateful for every note of the journey.

<p>I love attending concerts and going on tours to see my favorite artists perform live. There's something special about experiencing music in person, feeling the energy of the crowd, and hearing the songs I love performed with such passion.

<p>Other than concerts, I also have picked up videography and editing. I make monthly recaps of my life and upload them to my youtube channel. It mostly consists of hanging out with friends, eating good food, and going to events.
