    <h1>University</h1>
    <h3>Villanova University</h3>
    <h3>Bachelors of Science in Computer Science (Minor in Cybersecurity)</h3>

    <p>During my time at Villanova, I spent all four years involved with the band. We performed at almost all sports games. During my junior and senior year, I gained leadership roles as the Historian, taking pictures and videos for our social media pages.
        I also joined The Society of Scientist and Engineers as a member and later joining the electoral board as the Social Media Coordinator and the Vice President. We hosted events and meetings to help underclassmen on their path to success. Some of my favorite events we hosted were resume reviews, formals, and social bondings.

<h1>Music</h1>
<p>Music has been a very big part of my life. Since the fourth grade, I have been invested and married to the Trumpet.
I have been involved with the concert band, jazz band, percussion ensemble and more since my early education. In high school, I was lucky enough to spend two consecutive years with the Macyâ€™s Great American Marching Band at the Thanksgiving Parade. My senior year I was part of the handful of members chosen to play on the Today Show the morning of Thanksgiving.
During highschool, I enjoyed leading our high school marching band for 2 years as a Drum Major. Before that, I was a Section Leader, Drill Sergeant, and Drill Major.

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>One of my favorite things to do on my spare time is rating things I have read and watched.
    Another hobby I reently picked up in 2024 is going to concerts. So far, I have seen:
    <ul>
        <li>Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia</li>
        <li>Sabrina Carpenter - emails I can't send + Short n' Sweet</li>
        <li>Taylor Swift - The Eras Tour</li>
        <li>Olivia Rodrigo - Guts</li>
        <li>Joshua Bassett - The Golden Years</li>
        <li>5SOS - Take My Hand + Meet You There</li>
        <li>Jonas Brothers - The World Tour</li>
        <li>Tate Mcrae - Think Later</li>
        <li>Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft</li>
        <li>Remi Wolf - Big Ideas</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Other than concerts, I also have picked up videography and editing. I make monthly recaps of my life and upload them to my youtube channel. It mostly consists of hanging out with friends, eating good food, and going to events.
